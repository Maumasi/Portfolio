## About me
I am a combat veteran that was part of one of the U.S. militaries primer fighting forces, an Airborne Army Ranger in the 75th Ranger Regiment with multiple tours of duty in special operations. Within the first 30 days of exiting the military I started at Full Sail University in the bachelors program for web design and development. <br>

What interests me in web development in the first place is the fact that I can be as creative as I want to be. It’s satisfying to create something and even more so when I get to see others enjoy my work. Being able to build my own programs feels like having superpowers in the real world. <br>

I consider my self a serial-learner. I like building my skills and abilities I’ve already attained and I’m always interested in diving into something new and with all the tools available to programmers today and growing there is always something new to learn. <br>

This portfolio was designed to show small examples and demonstrations of just some of what I’ve been learning lately as well as some featured projects I had fun building. <br>

### How to use this Portfolio
This portfolio repository is meant to serve as a collection of code snippets that provide useful examples of code in varied languages and concepts. These examples are also my personal notes, which will continue to grow, and also, it might by useful to others beginning to learn core concepts or use cases.

# ES6
The new release of JavaScript know either as ES6 or ES2015 has some cool new toys for JavaScript developers to play with and this section takes a took at some of the new features.
- [ES6: Classes](https://github.com/Maumasi/Portfolio/tree/master/ES6/classes)
- [ES6: Array Helpers](https://github.com/Maumasi/Portfolio/tree/master/ES6/arrayHelpers)
<br>

# React Native
With mobile development becoming more and more in demand *React Native* leverages developers who already have the skill set to create web apps to be able to, now, create mobile apps. React Native compiles a large precent of ES6 JavaScript into the iOS and android mobile languages using only one source code for both platforms. It's like getting 2 developers for the price of one. That being said, not everything can be compiled into a platform's respective language using React Native, so this is not a perfect substitute for some apps that would require a native language solution.
- [React Native: Manipulating State](https://github.com/Maumasi/Portfolio/tree/master/React_Native/state_with_components)
<br>

# SASS
Finally, a clean way to develop CSS where specific component styles can be separated into individual styles without making a bazillion `<link>` tags. Writing SASS files makes creating, updating, removing, and overall maintenance of styles much less of a headache. This small demo demonstrates how to manage multiple files that handle styles for different components can be folded into 1 CSS file.
- [SASS: Imports, Vars, Mixins, oh my!](https://github.com/Maumasi/Portfolio/tree/master/SASS)
<br>

# PHP7
This new installation of PHP has given the language a real shot in the arm. PHP is not a fast executing language but with PHP7 it is about twice as fast as PHP5. Most methods and syntax that was deprecated from PHP7 was scheduled for removal in PHP5 that would otherwise issue a warning, so upgrading to PHP7 should be relatively simple. This code snippet demonstrated one of the new featuers of PHP7. **Note**: Even though the code may be easy to upgrade other software and hardware PHP7 is utilizing may not be as compatible, make sure it will work for your solution before attempting to implement a new version of any code base.
