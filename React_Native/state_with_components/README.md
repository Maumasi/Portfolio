# React Native: Manipulating State

This is a great segue to learn how properties can be passed between components across the entire app using a flux architecture. In this demo we'll just be looking at how using `state` can pass data to components within the same class.

**Note**
This demo will not be going over how to start a React Native project or how to build components. There is a [Resources]() section at the end of this demo to aid in research not included here.
