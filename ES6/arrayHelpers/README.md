# ES6: Array Helpers

These array helpers have been drafted onto ES5 because of their common use from various JavaScript libraries but in ES6 these array helpers are now fully integrated and are now seeing more implementation. These helpers cut down the blocks of code normally seen in traditional for loops. They are not only more readable but also more maintainable over time.
